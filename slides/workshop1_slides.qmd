# OVERVIEW

## **Who are we?**
This series of computational workshops at the Manship School of Mass Communication is made possible through the collaborative efforts of:

- BEACON Lab led by Drs. Ryan Wang & Josh Jackson (Behavioral and Empirical Approaches for COmputational Nexus): The BEACON Lab primarily focuses on advancing (computational) methodologies as well as introducing analytical skills.
- DiCCAL Research Group led by Drs. Janice Lee & Royce Choi (Digital Cognition and Computational Analytics Lab).The DiCCAL Research Group emphasizes applying these techniques within the fields of communication and social science.

  - Feb 14: Data wrangling
  - Feb 28: Data visualization
  - Mar 21: Basic textual analysis

## **Why R?**
We will be mainly using R(programming language) and RStudio (Integrated development environment, IDE)}.
        
- Open-source with a wide variety of statistics-related libraries
- Large online community 
- Great visualization: [Cédric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/top/dataviz/), [BBC](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot)
- You can also make website, slides, and etc. beyond coding
- Popular programming language in tech companies and academia
  - What about Python?


## **Some notes**

- Not trying to pack everything about R in three workshops. But hope to spark your interest in R.
- There will be a learning curve when transitioning from a graphical user interface (GUI)-oriented software to a syntax-based programming language
- Consistent practice is key to becoming proficient in a new **language**.
-  We always here to help! And peer learning is also another great way to gain insights. No dumb questions!

  - [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
  - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
  - (GP)TA: ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Deepseek (In my experience, ChatGPT performs pretty well in providing answers or guidance for any questions related to R language, particularly when employing proper prompts.
